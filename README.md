# Low-Latency-Occlusion-aware-work-Ben-Scott-IRP.
This includes code for the IAFE and different DCM implementations. THE DCM work uses LITE DEEP OC SORT code. This tracker code is not novel code and is from the papers GITHUB, this has been referenced in my thesis. Please give citation/ credit if this code is used to myself and the LITE DEEP OC SORT paper, including ULTRALYTICS and BOXMOT. The deeo_ocsort.py file fits into / can replace the LITE or boxmot github file of the same name. The code in question is the deep_ocsort.py - this includes code for each type of DCM and OAR mentioned in my thesis- as said in the code multiple times this code was built ontop of the code written by Mikel Brostr√∂m, Yolo Tracking.
