This includes code for the IAFE and different DCM implementations. THE DCM work uses LITE DEEP OC SORT code. This tracker code is not novel code and is from the papers GITHUB, this has been referenced in my thesis. Please give citation/ credit if this code is used to myself and the LITE DEEP OC SORT paper, including ULTRALYTICS and BOXMOT.
